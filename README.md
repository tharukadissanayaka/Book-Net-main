Book Net
---------
Book Net is a modern, full-stack web application designed to be an online marketplace and digital library for books. It provides users with a seamless experience to browse, purchase, and read a wide variety of books directly from their devices. This project is built to showcase a complete, end-to-end application and is perfect for demonstrating a strong grasp of the MERN stack.

Technology Stack
----------------
-> Frontend: The user interface is developed with ReactJS, creating a dynamic and responsive experience for navigating the site, viewing book details, and managing a personal library.

-> Backend: The server-side logic is powered by Node.js and the Express.js framework, which handle API requests, user authentication, and data management with speed and efficiency.

-> Database: MongoDB is used as the NoSQL database, providing a flexible schema to easily store and manage book information, user profiles, and transactional data.


This combination of technologies ensures a scalable, secure, and high-performance system for the Book Net platform.
